## Development status

Under significant development and breaking changes occur frequently.

## How to use

```shell
# clone repo
gh repo clone DeepCANFR/DeepCA---Hybrid-Deep-Learning-Cellular-Automata-Reservoir
cd DeepCA---Hybrid-Deep-Learning-Cellular-Automata-Reservoir/Trym
# create virtual environment with requirements
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install -r brainslicer/requirements.txt
```

Create experiment file

experiment1.py
```python
from .brainslicer import brainslicer as bs

if __name__ == '__main__':
    # your code

```
